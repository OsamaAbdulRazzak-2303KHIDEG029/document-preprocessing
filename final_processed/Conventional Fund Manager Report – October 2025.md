# Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report October 2025

## Economic &#x26; Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review &#x26; Outlook

Pakistan’s macroeconomic performance remained broadly stable in October 2025, supported by policy continuity and progress on external financing fronts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Government of Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement for the second review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The IMF noted that program execution under the EFF has remained strong, reflecting the government’s ongoing reform commitment. With the review concluded, Pakistan is set to receive the next disbursement of USD 1.2 billion in early December 2025, expected to strengthen external reserves and boost investor confidence.

On the external front, exports stood at USD 2.85 billion, showing a 4.5% YoY decline, while imports surged by 20.2% to USD 6.06 billion, leading to a 55.9% widening of the trade deficit to USD 3.21 billion. Despite this, resilient remittance inflows are likely to keep the current account deficit manageable. The SBP’s foreign exchange reserves remained stable at USD 14.5 billion, and the Pakistani rupee appreciated marginally by 0.1% against the US dollar, closing the month at PKR 280.9. Inflationary pressures persisted during the month, with headline CPI rising to 6.2% YoY, up from 5.6% in September 2025. The increase was mainly driven by a 2.7% MoM jump in food prices, particularly in wheat and vegetables. Meanwhile, core inflation edged up to 7.8% YoY from 7.3% a month earlier. For FY26, average CPI is projected at 7.1%, higher than 4.6% recorded in FY25.

On the fiscal side, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected PKR 3,835 billion during 4MFY26, reflecting a 12.5% growth year-on-year, though it fell short of the target by PKR 273 billion.

### Money Market Review &#x26; Outlook

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11%, citing an overall improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals. Inflation picked up to 6.2% YoY in October 2025, compared to 5.6% in the previous month. The rise stemmed from flood-related supply disruptions and temporary border closures that affected the flow of essential commodities. The MPC projected inflation to stay above the 5–7% target range during 2HFY26, before gradually converging toward the target thereafter.

During the review period, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held three T-Bill auctions, collectively targeting PKR 2.45 trillion against maturities totaling PKR 2.60 trillion.

- **First auction:** PKR 730 billion accepted at yields of 11.15%, 11.05%, 11.05%, and 11.19% for 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month papers.
- **Second auction:** PKR 776 billion accepted at 11.11%, 11.05%, 11.04%, and 11.25% across the same tenors.
- **Third auction:** PKR 1,134 billion accepted at 11.00%, 11.05%, 11.05%, and 11.35%, respectively.

In the PIB-Fixed auction, the SBP raised PKR 507 billion across 2-, 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year maturities, with cut-off yields of 11.33%, 11.35%, 11.50%, 12.00%, and 12.34%, respectively. The three PIB-Floater (10-year) issues accumulated PKR 247 billion, PKR 158 billion, and PKR 206 billion, offering spreads of 0.95%, 0.90%, and 0.87%.

Separately, the Government Ijarah Sukuk (GIS) auction via the PSX attracted PKR 310 billion, distributed among 1-year, 3-year FRR, 5-year FRR, 10-year zero-coupon, and...

### Equity Market Review &#x26; Outlook

The KSE-100 Index ended the month of October 2025 at 161,632 points, down 3,862 points (-2.3% MoM). The decline was primarily attributed to profit-taking by institutional investors, as geopolitical tensions along the Afghan border dampened investor confidence and overshadowed the positive sentiment from Pakistan’s recent staff-level agreement with the IMF.

Market participation, however, remained resilient. Average daily trading volumes rose 6.6% MoM to 1,430 million shares. In terms of investor flows, insurance companies (-USD 61.7 million), foreign investors (-USD 25.3 million), and mutual funds (-USD 16.0 million) were the major net sellers. Conversely, individual investors (+USD 70.3 million) and banks (+USD 17.6 million) absorbed much of the selling pressure, emerging as net buyers during the month.

From a sectoral perspective, Commercial Banks and Fertilizers were key outperformers, adding 1,796 and 595 points to the index. On the contrary, Exploration &#x26; Production (E&#x26;P) and Cement sectors weighed on performance, contributing -1,475 and -1,429 points, respectively.

Looking ahead, market direction in the near term is expected to be influenced by geopolitical developments, progress on the IMF tranche release, and the State Bank of Pakistan’s monetary policy decisions. Despite the recent correction, the market continues to trade below its historical valuation levels, with a forward P/E of 7.8x.
