Fund Managers' Report August 2025

# Economic & Capital Markets Review

## Economic Review & Outlook

In August 2025, Pakistan’s trade deficit widened to USD 2.9 billion, reflecting a 9% MoM improvement from July but a sharp 30% YoY increase, driven by a simultaneous decline in exports and sustained import demand. Exports fell by ~10% MoM to USD 2.42 billion, while imports stood at USD 5.29 billion, down ~9% MoM. Despite the monthly contraction in trade gap, the two-month (Jul–Aug) trade deficit for FY26 surged by 29% YoY to USD 6.0 billion.

Foreign exchange reserves remained stable, with SBP’s reserves at USD 14.3 billion by end-August, marginally down from July end balance. Total liquid reserves stood at USD 19.66 billion, reflecting continued support from multilateral inflows, remittances, and commercial borrowings. These reserve levels are seen as adequate in meeting short-term external obligations.

On the inflation front, headline CPI inflation eased to 3.0% YoY in August, down from 4.1% in July and significantly lower than the 9.6% recorded in August 2024. This disinflation was primarily driven by a favorable base effect and a drop in food prices. Month-on-month, CPI actually declined by 0.6%, reversing the sharp 2.9% increase seen in July. For the first two months of FY26, average inflation stands at 3.53%, a steep decline from 10.36% during the same period last year—underscoring the success of monetary tightening and improved supply-side dynamics. However, recent flooding poses upside risks to food prices and overall inflation in the coming months, potentially reversing some of the disinflation gains.

July 2025 tax collection came in at PKR 748.6 billion, marking a 14% YoY increase. Though this reflects positive momentum in revenue mobilization, the full-year FY25 tax collection of PKR 11,735 billion had missed the revised target by PKR 163 billion, highlighting persistent challenges in fiscal consolidation. Structural reforms in tax administration, including digitization initiatives approved in recent months, are expected to play a pivotal role in improving efficiency and broadening the tax base going forward.

## Money Market Review & Outlook

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held its Treasury bill auction on August 20, 2025, with maturities totaling PKR 445 billion against a target of PKR 450 billion. The central bank accepted bids worth PKR 16 billion in the 1-month tenor, PKR 24 billion in 3 months, PKR 51 billion in 6 months, and PKR 18 billion in 12 months, at cut-off yields of 10.90%, 10.85%, 10.85%, and 11.00%, respectively.

Earlier in the month, on August 1, SBP conducted an auction for fixed-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), facing maturities of PKR 585 billion against a set target of PKR 300 billion. The auction saw acceptance of PKR 28 billion in 2-year bonds, PKR 47 billion in 3-year, PKR 43 billion in 5-year, PKR 221 billion in 10-year, and PKR 300 billion in 15-year papers, with respective cut-off yields of 11.09%, 11.14%, 11.44%, 12.15%, and 12.45%.

Meanwhile, the secondary market remained largely stable throughout the month, reflecting investor expectations of a status quo in the upcoming monetary policy. The central bank is likely to retain a data-driven approach, carefully assessing the temporary inflationary impact of flood-related supply disruptions against the backdrop of improving external and fiscal indicators. While there is room for a 50–100 bps rate cut in the coming months, the Monetary Policy Committee may opt to hold rates steady in the near term to better evaluate the scale and persistence of the flood-induced economic shock.

## Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index concluded August 2025 on a strong footing after reaching a new milestone of 150,000 points during the month, however, closing a little lower at 148,618 points. This represented a 6.62% month-on-month gain. The performance highlights sustained investor confidence, improved macroeconomic stability, and a resilient corporate earnings outlook.

The month began on a positive note, Pakistan secured a competitive import tariff of 19% from the U.S., notably lower than those faced by peer exporters. This trade development, alongside improving macroeconomic fundamentals, helped sustain market momentum. Moreover, Moody’s recent upgrade of Pakistan’s sovereign rating from Caa2 to Caa1 signaled growing confidence in the country’s economic outlook.

Trading activity improved markedly during the month, with average daily volumes climbing 17% MoM to 305.8 million shares—a sign of growing retail and institutional participation. Foreign investors continued to remain cautious, recording net outflows of USD 43.1 million for the month, whereas local participants, particularly Mutual Funds, Individuals and Corporates, emerged as net buyers. Banks, on the other hand, were net sellers.

Despite the recent strong gains, valuations remain attractive. The KSE-100 Index trades at a forward P/E of around 7.6x, below its historical average, and offers a robust dividend yield of 7%. Coupled with improving corporate profitability and greater external sector stability, these factors present a compelling risk-reward profile for investors with a medium- to long-term investment horizon. As macroeconomic conditions continue to stabilize and earnings momentum builds, the equity market appears well-positioned for further upside potential.

From a sectoral perspective, Commercial Banks, Cement, and Exploration & Production (E&P) companies were the primary drivers of market performance, adding 3,762, 2,539, and 939 points, respectively, to the KSE-100 Index. Conversely, Chemical and Fertilizer sectors came under selling pressure, dragging the index down by 118 and 96 points, respectively.
