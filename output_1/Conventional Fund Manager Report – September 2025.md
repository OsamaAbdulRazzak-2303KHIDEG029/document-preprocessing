Fund Managers' Report September 2025

# Economic & Capital Markets Review

## Economic Review & Outlook

September 2025 marked a mixed month for Pakistan’s external sector. Export receipts inched up by 3.6% MoM to USD 2.5 billion, while imports climbed more sharply by 10.5%, totaling USD 5.85 billion. This led to a 16.3% expansion in the trade deficit, which settled at USD 3.34 billion. Even so, the overall external balance is expected to stay largely contained, supported by steady remittance inflows. The State Bank’s reserves remained firm at USD 14.4 billion, and the rupee appreciated slightly by 0.2% against the dollar, closing the month at PKR 281.3.

Inflation saw an uptick during the month, driven primarily by a rebound in food prices after the floods. The headline CPI accelerated to 5.6% YoY from 3.0% in August, as food prices rose by 5.5% MoM. Meanwhile, core inflation stayed anchored at 7.3% YoY, pointing to contained demand-side pressures. For FY26, inflation is expected to average 6.3%, compared with 4.6% in the previous fiscal year. On the fiscal side, FBR tax revenues reached PKR 2,885 billion during 1QFY26, up 12.8% YoY, though PKR 198 billion short of the quarterly target.

Early reports on flood damage indicate a relatively mild impact compared to the devastating events of 2010 and 2022. Sindh province escaped major destruction, with only limited waterlogging observed in certain low-lying districts. Importantly, key summer crops such as rice, cotton, and sugarcane have been largely unaffected, and harvesting activities are proceeding normally. Encouragingly, prices of perishable commodities and wheat have started to ease, hinting at a gradual stabilization in food supply and inflation expectations.

## Money Market Review & Outlook

Yields in Pakistan’s secondary market posted moderate gains during September 2025, reflecting investor expectations of steady monetary policy in the near term. Short-term papers rose by around 15 basis points, while long-term bonds edged up by 6 basis points. The movement indicates a market consensus that the State Bank is likely to maintain its current stance for the next few months.

At its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on September 15, 2025, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the policy rate unchanged at 11.0%. The central bank noted that recent floods could temporarily disrupt supply chains, adding pressure on food prices and potentially widening the external deficit in FY26. Given these uncertainties, the MPC chose to adopt a cautious wait-and-see approach until clearer macroeconomic signals emerge.

Activity in the government securities market remained healthy. In the T-bill auction held on September 17, maturities totaled PKR 197 billion against a target of PKR 175 billion. The SBP accepted bids worth PKR 16 billion (1-month), PKR 111 billion (3-month), PKR 59 billion (6-month), and PKR 9 billion (12-month) at cut-off yields of 10.75%, 10.85%, 10.84%, and 11.00%, respectively. Earlier in the month, on September 5, the fixed-coupon PIB auction was conducted with a PKR 400 billion target. The central bank accepted bids of PKR 43 billion (2-year), PKR 8 billion (3-year), PKR 115 billion (5-year), PKR 208 billion (10-year), and PKR 280 billion (longer-tenor) at cut-off yields of 11.20%, 11.14%, 11.44%, 12.04%, and 12.38%, respectively.

Looking ahead, the SBP is expected to maintain a data-driven and cautious stance as it evaluates the economic impact of recent supply shocks and monitors inflation.

## Equity Market Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s equity market extended its strong rally in September 2025, with the KSE-100 Index gaining 16,876 points (+11.36% MoM) to close at a record high of 165,494. The surge was driven by improving political and economic sentiment, particularly following the signing of the Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and the Prime Minister’s meeting with the U.S. President, which renewed foreign investment interest and strengthened investor confidence.

On the domestic front, sentiment improved further after the government finalized a PKR 1.2 trillion circular debt resolution plan, signaling progress in addressing long-standing power sector challenges. Market activity also picked up, with average daily volumes up 82% MoM to 1.34 billion shares and traded value rising 30% to USD 194.5 million. While foreign investors recorded outflows of USD 57.3 million, local mutual funds and individuals supported the market with combined inflows of USD 121.2 million.

The rally was led by Commercial Banks (+4,143 points), Exploration & Production (+2,414 points), and the Power sector (+2,265 points), buoyed by attractive valuations and optimism around the government’s debt clearance plan.

Looking ahead, market direction will depend on macroeconomic indicators, progress on IMF EFF targets ahead of the October 2025 review, and potential investment inflows from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. Despite recent gains, valuations remain attractive with the market trading at a forward P/E of 8.1x and a dividend yield of 6.0%, offering compelling opportunities for medium- to long-term investors.
