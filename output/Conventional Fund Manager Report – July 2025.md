Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report July 2025

Economic &#x26; Capital Markets Review

Economic Review &#x26; Outlook

March 2025 brought encouraging developments for Pakistan’s economy, particularly on the external front. Exports rose by 5.1% month-on-month to USD 2.62 billion, while imports dipped slightly by 1.1% to USD 4.74 billion. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed by 7.8% to USD 2.1 billion. With strong remittance inflows during Ramazan, the current account has recorded a surplus of USD 691 million in the first eight months.

S&#x26;P upgraded Pakistan’s long-term sovereign credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ after 2.5 years, citing improved external and fiscal stability—following similar actions by Moody’s (banking sector outlook) and Fitch (credit rating to ‘B-’ with a stable outlook). The SBP projects FX reserves to reach USD 15.5Bn by Dec’25 and USD 17.5Bn by Jun’26, factoring in external debt repayments and higher imports.

Pakistan’s FY26 external debt stands at USD 25.9Bn, with USD 16Bn expected to be rolled over and the remaining USD 10Bn (USD 4Bn interest, USD 6Bn principal) covered by existing reserves, supporting a stable Rupee outlook. In its Jul’25 meeting, SBP-MPC kept the policy rate unchanged at 11%, citing inflation risks from food and energy prices, though it expects inflation to normalize within 5-7% and GDP growth at 3.25-4.25% in FY26.

Inflationary pressures continued to ease, with July 2025 CPI expected at approximately 4.1% YoY — reflecting lower food prices, contained energy costs, and currency stability. If these dynamics persist, inflation is likely to remain subdued in the near term, giving the central bank room to consider further monetary easing. Looking ahead, positive developments and encouraging macroeconomic indicators pave the way for a more resilient and stable Pakistani economy. With headline inflation continuing to moderate, the environment remains conducive to sustained growth and improved economic performance.

### Money Market Review &#x26; Outlook

The SBP’s decision to maintain the policy rate was driven by concerns over potential inflationary pressures, primarily stemming from rising global oil prices amid geopolitical tensions and the risk of unexpected import-driven currency depreciation. However, core inflation continued to ease, supported by a favorable base effect and subdued consumer demand, offering the central bank some space to support growth without triggering additional inflation.

On the market front, the SBP conducted a Treasury bill auction on July 9, 2025, successfully raising PKR 1.49 trillion against a target of PKR 1.35 trillion. Investor demand remained strong, with cut-off yields at 11.24% for 1-month, 10.99% for 3-month, 10.89% for 6-month, and 10.80% for 12-month papers. Yields on longer tenors stayed comparatively lower, reflecting market expectations of a possible rate cut in upcoming policy meetings—despite the central bank holding rates steady for now.

Looking ahead, the ongoing disinflation trend provides a supportive backdrop for fixed income markets, though the timing and extent of future rate cuts will likely depend on the SBP’s confidence in maintaining adequate FX reserves. For fixed income investors, the current environment presents opportunities for capital gains, particularly in mid-to-long duration instruments, assuming macroeconomic stability persists.

### Equity Market Review &#x26; Outlook

The equity market witnessed a strong bullish run in July, with the KSE-100 Index hitting an all-time high of 140,585 points, driven by a series of positive developments including the finalization of a trade deal between Pakistan and the U.S., a FY25 current account surplus of USD 2.1bn, improved inflation outlook with prospects of monetary easing, an upgrade in Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating by S&#x26;P to ‘B -’ from ‘CCC+’, and continued improvement in the external sector.

Despite net foreign selling of USD 31.2mn, robust domestic investor sentiment sustained the rally. The upgrade by S&#x26;P, following similar rating outlook improvements by Moody’s and Fitch, reflects a more stable fiscal outlook and external position. Meanwhile, the SBP maintained the policy rate at 11% in its July MPC meeting, highlighting near-term inflationary risks from food and energy prices, though it expects headline inflation to return to the 5 -7% target range and GDP growth between 3.25-4.25% in FY26, underpinning a cautiously optimistic macroeconomic backdrop for equities.

Market participation also improved, with average daily volumes rising by 8.1% month-on-month to 261 million shares. Foreign investors remained net sellers, offloading USD 31.75 million, while local corporates and individual investors stepped in. On the sectoral front, Commercial Banks, Fertilizers, and Inv.Banks/Inv.Cos were the leading contributors, adding 7,072, 2520, and 977 points, respectively.

Looking forward, investor attention will likely shift to macroeconomic indicators and the government’s progress on IMF program conditions ahead of the upcoming September 2025 review. Additionally, the State Bank of Pakistan’s monetary policy stance and evolving geopolitical dynamics will play a key role in shaping near-term sentiment. Despite a strong run, the market continues to trade at a valuation discount. With a forward P/E ratio of 7.2x still at a discount compared to its long-term average of 8.5x, the equity market offers attractive opportunities for medium- to long-term investors.
